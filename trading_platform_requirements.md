## 2. Goals and Objectives
   2.1. Primary Goals:
    *   Develop a platform for visualizing SPY ticker data, including candlestick charts and high/low price overlays.
    *   Implement the standard Relative Strength Index (RSI) and design a flexible framework that allows users to define and visualize their own custom financial indicators.
    *   Integrate capabilities to acquire SPY data, prepare it for, and use it to tune and analyze the outputs from open-source machine learning models (e.g., time-series forecasting models from Meta's open-source catalogue or similar).
    *   Leverage FinRL as the core library for financial data handling, environment simulations (if applicable), and potentially for reinforcement learning agent training in future iterations.
   2.2. Secondary Objectives:
    *   Provide a modular and extensible software architecture to facilitate future enhancements and maintenance.
    *   Ensure the system is well-documented, covering code, architecture, and user guides for ease of development, understanding, and contribution.
    *   Lay the groundwork for potential future enhancements such as support for additional financial instruments (beyond SPY), integration of more advanced ML models, or connection to live data sources.
   2.3. Success Criteria:
    *   Successful and accurate plotting of SPY candlestick charts, clearly displaying open, high, low, and close prices.
    *   Accurate calculation and clear visualization of the RSI for SPY data.
    *   Demonstrable integration and visualization of at least one user-defined custom indicator, showcasing the framework's flexibility.
    *   Successful acquisition of SPY data, pre-processing, fine-tuning of a selected open-source ML model, and visualization of its generated insights or trading signals (e.g., buy/sell markers on the chart).
    *   The system architecture and implementation clearly demonstrate the use of FinRL for its core financial data processing and analysis functionalities.

## 3. Scope
   3.1. In Scope:
    *   Data ingestion for the SPY ticker from a publicly available data source (e.g., yfinance API).
    *   Calculation and visualization of High, Low, Open, Close prices (Candlestick charts) for SPY.
    *   Calculation and visualization of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for SPY.
    *   A defined mechanism/framework for users to implement custom technical indicators in Python. These custom indicators should be visualizable on the charts alongside price data and standard indicators. (Note: The system provides the Python framework; translation of logic from other platforms like TradingView Pine Script to Python is a user responsibility).
    *   A data preparation, fine-tuning, and inference pipeline for at least one selected open-source ML model relevant to time-series analysis (e.g., a model from Meta's open-source projects, if applicable and suitable for financial forecasting on SPY data).
    *   Basic visualization of the ML model's outputs. This could include plotting buy/sell signals, predicted trend directions, or confidence intervals directly on the price chart or in a dedicated panel.
    *   The application will primarily be developed as a set of standalone Python scripts or a simple web-based interface if achievable within the project constraints, emphasizing FinRL's capabilities.
    *   The primary and initial focus for all features is exclusively on the SPY ticker.
   3.2. Out of Scope:
    *   Real-time data streaming, automated trading execution, or any direct brokerage integration.
    *   User account management, persistent user profiles, authentication, or personalization features in this initial version.
    *   Support for a wide array of financial instruments or data formats beyond SPY from the specified source.
    *   Direct execution, interpretation, or transpilation of TradingView Pine Script code. Users are expected to translate their indicator logic into Python to use the custom indicator framework.
    *   A highly sophisticated, commercial-grade User Interface (UI) or User Experience (UX). Functionality and FinRL integration are prioritized.
    *   Support for any financial tickers other than SPY in this initial MVP.
    *   Automated, advanced hyperparameter optimization techniques for ML models (manual tuning or simple grid search is assumed for the fine-tuning process).
    *   Cloud deployment, distributed computing, or advanced scalability features. The system is envisioned for local, single-user operation initially.

## 4. Technology Stack

This section details the proposed technologies for building the FinRL-based Trading Analysis Platform. The choices prioritize using FinRL as the central component, open-source tools, and Python-based solutions.

### 4.1. Core Framework: FinRL
*   **Technology:** FinRL (Financial Reinforcement Learning Library)
*   **Usage:** Core library for financial data processing, feature engineering, interaction with market environments, and potentially for backtesting strategies informed by ML models. It provides a foundation for financial task handling.

### 4.2. Data Acquisition
*   **Technology:** `yfinance` library
*   **Usage:** To download historical market data for SPY (and potentially other tickers in the future) from Yahoo Finance. It's simple, widely used, and integrates well with Python.
*   **Alternatives (to be considered if `yfinance` is insufficient):** Alpaca API, IEX Cloud API (may require API keys and have usage limits).

### 4.3. Data Storage (Optional)
*   **Technology:** CSV files or SQLite database
*   **Usage:** For locally caching downloaded data to avoid repeated API calls and for faster access during development and analysis. SQLite can offer more structured storage if metadata or multiple datasets are involved. For the initial MVP, CSVs might be sufficient.
*   **Consideration:** The need for persistent storage depends on the volume of data and frequency of use. FinRL itself can work with in-memory Pandas DataFrames.

### 4.4. Charting Library
*   **Technology:** Plotly Dash or Streamlit (with Plotly for charts)
*   **Usage:** For creating interactive charts (candlesticks, line charts for indicators like RSI, and visualizing ML model outputs).
    *   **Plotly Dash:** Offers more flexibility for building comprehensive web applications with complex UIs. It has a steeper learning curve.
    *   **Streamlit:** Simpler to get started with for creating data-centric web apps. Good for rapid prototyping and internal tools. Can embed Plotly charts.
*   **Choice Rationale:** Both are Python-native and well-suited for interactive financial visualizations. The choice between them might depend on the desired complexity of the UI. Given the "FinRL-centric" nature, Streamlit might be a quicker way to build a UI around the core FinRL logic.

### 4.5. Machine Learning Framework
*   **Technology:** PyTorch
*   **Usage:** For loading, fine-tuning, and running inference with open-source machine learning models, particularly those released by Meta (which are often PyTorch-based). Libraries like `transformers` (from Hugging Face) can be used for accessing pre-trained models.
*   **Supporting Libraries:** `scikit-learn` for data preprocessing for ML, and standard ML evaluation metrics.

### 4.6. Backend Framework (If applicable)
*   **Technology:** FastAPI or Flask (if a more complex web application beyond Streamlit's capabilities is envisioned)
*   **Usage:** To build a RESTful API if the application requires a decoupled frontend or needs to serve data/model predictions to other services.
*   **Consideration:** For the initial scope focusing on analysis and tuning by a single user, a dedicated backend might be overkill if Streamlit or a script-based approach is used. This can be a future enhancement.

### 4.7. Frontend Framework (If applicable)
*   **Technology:** (Implicitly Streamlit or Dash's built-in components)
*   **Usage:** If a web application is built using Streamlit or Dash, their respective component models will serve as the frontend framework. A separate frontend framework (like React, Vue) is considered out of scope for the initial version to keep complexity manageable and stay Python-focused.

### 4.8. Justification for Choices
*   **Python Ecosystem:** All chosen technologies are primarily Python-based, ensuring seamless integration and leveraging the extensive Python libraries for data science and finance.
*   **Open Source:** Prioritizing open-source tools reduces costs and allows for greater flexibility and community support.
*   **FinRL-Centricity:** FinRL is the designated core, with other tools chosen to complement its capabilities for data acquisition, visualization, and ML integration.
*   **Scalability (Future):** While the initial focus is on a local setup, choices like FastAPI/Dash allow for future scalability into a more robust web service if needed.
*   **Ease of Use for ML:** PyTorch is a standard for deep learning research and deployment, aligning with the goal of using Meta's open-source models.

## 5. System Architecture

This section describes the proposed architecture for the FinRL-based Trading Analysis Platform. The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing for clear separation of concerns and easier development and maintenance.

### 5.1. Overall Architecture Diagram (Conceptual)

*(Since a textual representation of a diagram is limited, this will be a description. A developer can use this description to draw a visual diagram.)*

The system can be conceptualized as a pipeline with a user interface layer:

1.  **User Interface (UI) Layer:** The user interacts here (e.g., selects SPY, views charts, triggers ML model tuning). This could be a Streamlit/Dash web interface or command-line invocations.
2.  **Orchestration/Control Layer:** Manages user requests and coordinates the actions of different modules. (Implicit in the UI event handlers or main script logic).
3.  **Core Modules (interact with each other):**
    *   **Data Acquisition Module:** Fetches data from external sources.
    *   **Data Processing Module:** Cleans and prepares data for charting and ML.
    *   **Indicator Calculation Module:** Computes technical indicators.
    *   **Machine Learning Module:** Handles ML model operations.
    *   **Charting Module:** Generates visualizations.
4.  **Data Storage (Optional):** Local cache for market data.
5.  **External Data Source:** e.g., Yahoo Finance.

**Flow Example:**
User requests SPY chart with RSI -> UI Layer sends request -> Orchestration Layer triggers Data Acquisition -> Data Processing -> Indicator Calculation (RSI) -> Charting Module generates chart -> UI Layer displays chart.

    *   A portion of the processed data is sent to the Machine Learning Module for further specific preprocessing.
    *   The ML model is loaded/tuned/run for inference.
    *   ML outputs (predictions/signals) are generated.
6.  **Charting:** The Charting Module receives the processed OHLC data, indicator values, and ML outputs. It generates the visualizations.
7.  **Display:** The UI Layer renders the charts and any other relevant information (tables, metrics) for the user.

Data is primarily passed between modules as Pandas DataFrames. Configuration settings (e.g., indicator parameters, ML model choices) will also flow from the UI/config files to the relevant modules.

## 6. Detailed Feature Specifications

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the features to be implemented in the trading analysis platform.

### 6.1. User Authentication
*   **Status:** Out of Scope for the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
*   **Description:** User accounts, login/logout functionality, and personalized settings are not planned for the first version to maintain focus on core analytical features. Future versions might consider this.

### 6.2. Data Ingestion and Management

#### 6.2.1. Fetching SPY Ticker Data
*   **Description:** The system must be able to download historical daily market data for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY).
*   **Data Points:** Open, High, Low, Close, Volume (OHLCV).
*   **Source:** Yahoo Finance (via `yfinance` library).
*   **Frequency:** On-demand by the user or when the application starts.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for network issues or unavailability of data.
*   **Configuration:** Ticker symbol (SPY) should be configurable, although SPY is the primary focus.

#### 6.2.2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
*   **Description:** Raw data fetched from the source should be checked and prepared for analysis.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Handle missing data points (e.g., through forward-fill, backward-fill, or interpolation if appropriate, or by noting gaps).
    *   Ensure correct data types for each column (e.g., datetime for dates, numeric for prices/volume).
    *   Adjust for stock splits/dividends if not handled by `yfinance` (though `yfinance` usually provides adjusted data).
*   **Output:** A clean, usable Pandas DataFrame.

### 6.3. Charting

#### 6.3.1. Candlestick Charts
*   **Description:** Display SPY price data using candlestick charts.
*   **Elements:** Each candlestick should represent one day (or user-selected period if timeframe selection is added later) and show Open, High, Low, and Close prices.
*   **Interactivity:**
    *   Zooming and panning.
    *   Hover-over tooltips showing OHLCV values for a specific period.
*   **Volume Display:** Optionally, display trading volume as a bar chart below the main price chart.

#### 6.3.2. Plotting High/Low
*   **Description:** The High and Low values are integral parts of the candlestick chart. Additionally, the system could plot separate lines for daily High and Low prices if desired, or moving averages of High/Low.
*   **Visualisation:** Clearly distinguishable on the chart.

### 6.4. Technical Indicators

#### 6.4.1. RSI (Relative Strength Index)
*   **Description:** Calculate and display the RSI for SPY.
*   **Calculation:** Standard RSI calculation formula (typically over a 14-period lookback, but this should be configurable).
*   **Display:** Plotted as a line chart in a separate panel below or overlaid on the main price chart.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   Lookback period (e.g., 14 days).
    *   Overbought/Oversold levels (e.g., 70/30 or 80/20) should be displayed as horizontal lines.

#### 6.4.2. Framework for Custom Indicators
*   **Description:** Allow users to define and integrate their own custom technical indicators written in Python. The goal is to provide a way to translate logic from systems like TradingView's Pine Script into Python functions that the platform can execute and plot.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   **Defined Interface:** Specify a clear Python function signature or class structure that users must adhere to when creating their custom indicators. This interface should accept a Pandas DataFrame of OHLCV data and any necessary parameters.
    *   **Dynamic Loading:** The system should be able to discover and load these custom indicator plugins/scripts (e.g., from a specific 'custom_indicators' folder).
    *   **Parameterization:** Users should be able to provide parameters to their custom indicators (e.g., lookback periods, multipliers).
    *   **Output:** Custom indicators should output data (e.g., Pandas Series or DataFrame columns) that can be plotted on the chart, either as overlays or in separate panes.
    *   **Example:** Provide a simple example of a custom indicator (e.g., a simple moving average) to guide users.

##### 6.4.2.1. Defining Custom Indicator Logic
*   **Method:** Users will write Python functions. Each function will take a DataFrame (OHLCV) and parameters as input, and return a Series or DataFrame representing the calculated indicator values.
*   **Example (Conceptual):**
    ```python
    # In a user's custom_indicator_sma.py
    def simple_moving_average(data_df, period=20):
        # 'data_df' is expected to have a 'Close' column
        return data_df['Close'].rolling(window=period).mean()
    ```

##### 6.4.2.2. Integrating Custom Indicators with Charting
*   **Discovery:** The application will scan a predefined directory for Python files containing indicator functions.
*   **Selection:** The UI should allow users to select available custom indicators and specify their parameters.
*   **Plotting:** The charting module will take the output of these functions and plot them, similar to how RSI is plotted.

### 6.5. Machine Learning Model Integration

#### 6.5.1. Data Preparation for ML Models
*   **Description:** Transform financial time series data into a format suitable for the selected open-source ML models (e.g., from Meta's offerings like time series models, or general-purpose models that can be adapted).
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Feature scaling (normalization/standardization).
    *   Creation of sequences/windows if using recurrent or transformer-based models.
    *   Encoding of any categorical features (if applicable, less common for pure price data).
    *   Splitting data into training, validation, and testing sets.
*   **Tools:** `scikit-learn`, Pandas, NumPy.

#### 6.5.2. Loading and Fine-tuning Open-Source ML Models
*   **Description:** Integrate at least one open-source ML model (PyTorch-based, potentially from Meta's catalogue if suitable for financial time series forecasting or signal generation).
*   **Model Selection:** The specific model will be chosen based on its applicability to financial time series data and ease of use (e.g., a transformer-based time series model, or adapting a general model).
*   **Loading:** Use libraries like Hugging Face `transformers` to load pre-trained models if applicable, or implement the model architecture in PyTorch.
*   **Fine-tuning:**
    *   Implement a training loop in PyTorch.
    *   Define appropriate loss functions (e.g., Mean Squared Error for price prediction, Cross-Entropy for signal classification).
    *   Allow basic hyperparameter configuration (e.g., learning rate, number of epochs).
*   **Output:** A fine-tuned model saved locally.

#### 6.5.3. Generating and Displaying Model Insights/Signals
*   **Description:** Use the fine-tuned model to make predictions or generate trading signals on new/unseen data.
*   **Inference:** Load the tuned model and run inference on the test set or recent data.

    *   Predicted future price movement (e.g., up/down, or a price range).
    *   Buy/Sell/Hold signals.
    *   Trend strength or direction.
*   **Visualization:**
    *   Overlay signals (e.g., buy/sell arrows) on the price chart.
    *   Plot predicted price paths against actual prices.
    *   Display confidence scores or other relevant model outputs in a separate panel or table.

### 6.6. Configuration Management
*   **Description:** Allow users to configure certain aspects of the application.
*   **Configurable Items (Examples):**
    *   RSI period.
    *   Parameters for custom indicators.
    *   Paths to ML models or data.
    *   Chart appearance settings (basic).
*   **Method:** Via a configuration file (e.g., YAML, JSON) or through UI elements if a web app is built.

## 7. Data Management

This section outlines how data will be acquired, stored (if applicable), processed, and managed within the platform. The primary focus is on SPY market data.

### 7.1. Data Sources
*   **Primary Data Source:** Yahoo Finance.
*   **Access Method:** The `yfinance` Python library will be used to fetch historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data.
*   **Ticker:** Initially, the system will focus exclusively on SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust). The design should allow for easy extension to other tickers in the future, although this is not part of the MVP.
*   **Data Granularity:** Daily historical data will be the primary focus. Intraday data is out of scope for the initial version due to increased complexity in handling and sourcing.

### 7.2. Data Storage and Retrieval (Caching)
*   **Necessity:** To avoid redundant API calls to Yahoo Finance, improve performance, and ensure data availability during offline use or API rate limiting, a local caching mechanism is recommended.
*   **Proposed Storage:**
    *   **CSV Files:** Simple to implement. Each ticker's data (e.g., `SPY_daily.csv`) can be stored as a separate CSV file. This is suitable for the initial MVP.
    *   **SQLite Database:** A more robust solution if metadata (e.g., last download date, data source) or data for multiple tickers needs to be managed more systematically. Can also store configuration or user preferences in the future.
*   **Retrieval Logic:**
    1.  When data for SPY is requested, the system first checks if a recent, valid cached version exists locally.
    2.  If a valid cache exists and is up-to-date (e.g., based on a daily refresh policy), it's used.
    3.  If no cache exists, or it's stale, the system fetches fresh data from Yahoo Finance via `yfinance`.
    4.  The newly fetched data is then saved/updated in the local cache.
*   **Location:** Cached data will be stored in a predefined local directory (e.g., `data/cache/`).

### 7.3. Data Update Frequency
*   **User-Triggered:** Data updates will primarily be triggered by the user, either by explicitly requesting a refresh or when the application starts (configurable behavior).
*   **Policy for Cache:** The system should consider data stale if it's older than a certain period (e.g., end of the previous trading day for daily data).
*   **No Real-time Streaming:** Continuous real-time data updates are out of scope for the MVP.

### 7.4. Data Processing Pipeline
*   **Initial Processing:** As described in Section 5.2.2 (Data Processing Module) and 6.2.2 (Data Preprocessing and Cleaning).
    *   Fetching via `yfinance`.
    *   Handling missing values.
    *   Ensuring correct data types.
    *   Adjustments (e.g., for splits, dividends - typically handled by `yfinance`).
*   **FinRL Integration:** Data will be formatted into Pandas DataFrames, which is the standard input for most FinRL functionalities. FinRL's own data processors or environment wrappers might be used if the project incorporates reinforcement learning agents or specific FinRL backtesting environments.
*   **Feature Engineering:**
    *   Basic features (e.g., price changes, returns) will be calculated.
    *   Technical indicators (RSI, custom ones) are generated by the Indicator Calculation Module.
    *   Further feature engineering specific to ML models will be handled by the Machine Learning Module (e.g., creating lagged features, sequences).

### 7.5. Data Integrity and Validation
*   **Basic Checks:**
    *   Check for obviously erroneous data (e.g., negative prices/volume, if not handled by `yfinance`).
    *   Log any encountered data issues.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure timestamps are consistent and data is sorted chronologically.
*   **Scope:** Extensive data validation is not a primary focus for MVP but basic sanity checks are expected.

### 7.6. Data Retention Policy (for cached data)
*   **Policy:** All historical data downloaded for SPY will be retained in the local cache unless manually cleared by the user.
*   **Management:** No automatic deletion of old cached data is planned for the MVP. Users will be responsible for managing the cache size if it becomes an issue. Future versions could implement a more sophisticated cache management strategy (e.g., LRU cache, size limits).

## 8. Machine Learning Integration

This section details the workflow for integrating, training/fine-tuning, and utilizing machine learning models (with a focus on open-source models from sources like Meta, using PyTorch) for analyzing SPY ticker data.

### 8.1. ML Model Selection Rationale
*   **Objective:** To identify trends, generate potential trading signals, or provide forecasts based on historical SPY data.
*   **Model Type Focus:**
    *   **Time Series Models:** Models inherently designed for sequential data (e.g., Transformer-based time series models, LSTMs, GRUs if simpler models are preferred initially). Many Meta AI releases might fall into language or vision, so careful selection of models adaptable to financial time series is key.
    *   **Signal Generation Models:** Classification models that predict discrete outcomes (e.g., buy/sell/hold, trend up/down).
*   **Criteria for Selection (for this project):**
    *   **Open Source:** Must be publicly available.
    *   **PyTorch-based:** To align with the chosen ML framework.
    *   **Adaptability:** The model should be adaptable to financial time series data, even if not originally designed for it. This might involve feature engineering to create suitable inputs.
    *   **Documentation & Community Support:** Well-documented models are preferred.
    *   **Feasibility:** Achievable to implement and fine-tune within the project scope.
*   **Example Candidate Search:** Explore Meta AI's open-source catalogue (e.g., on GitHub, Hugging Face) for models related to time series analysis, forecasting, or sequence processing that could be repurposed. If direct financial models are scarce, consider models that learn patterns in sequences.

### 8.2. Data Preparation Pipeline for ML
This outlines the steps to transform raw/processed financial data into a format suitable for ML model training and inference.

1.  **Input Data:** Cleaned and processed OHLCV data for SPY from the Data Management module (Pandas DataFrame).
2.  **Feature Engineering for ML:**
    *   **Lagged Features:** Create lagged versions of price, volume, or derived indicators (e.g., previous day's close, RSI from N days ago).
    *   **Time-based Features:** Day of the week, month, year (if deemed relevant).
    *   **Technical Indicators as Features:** Use RSI and other custom indicator outputs as input features.
    *   **Target Variable Definition:**
        *   For forecasting: Future price (e.g., next day's close).
        *   For signal generation: Categorical labels (e.g., +1 for price increase > X%, -1 for price decrease > X%, 0 for hold).
3.  **Data Splitting:**
    *   **Chronological Split:** Crucial for time series data to prevent lookahead bias.
    *   **Training Set:** Used to train/fine-tune the model.
    *   **Validation Set:** Used to tune hyperparameters and for early stopping during training.
    *   **Test Set:** Used for final evaluation of the tuned model on unseen data.
4.  **Scaling/Normalization:**
    *   Apply scaling (e.g., MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler from `scikit-learn`) to numerical features to bring them into a consistent range. Fit scaler only on the training set and transform validation/test sets.
5.  **Sequencing (for sequential models):**
    *   If using RNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers, transform data into sequences of a fixed length (e.g., use data from the last `N` days to predict the next day).
6.  **Data Loaders (PyTorch):**
    *   Create PyTorch `Dataset` and `DataLoader` objects to efficiently feed data to the model during training and evaluation.

### 8.3. Model Training/Fine-tuning Workflow

1.  **Model Loading:**
    *   Load a pre-trained model architecture (if applicable) using libraries like Hugging Face `transformers` or define the model structure in PyTorch.
    *   If starting from scratch or a generic architecture, initialize model weights.
2.  **Define Optimizer:** Select an optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD) from `torch.optim`.
3.  **Define Loss Function:**
    *   For forecasting: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
    *   For classification (signals): Cross-Entropy Loss.
4.  **Training Loop:**
    *   Iterate over the training data for a specified number of epochs.
    *   In each epoch, iterate over batches from the `DataLoader`.
    *   Perform forward pass: Get model predictions.
    *   Calculate loss: Compare predictions to actual values.
    *   Perform backward pass: Calculate gradients.
    *   Update weights: Optimizer takes a step.
    *   Zero gradients.
5.  **Validation:**
    *   After each epoch (or every few epochs), evaluate the model on the validation set.
    *   Track validation loss and other relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy for classification).
    *   Implement early stopping: Stop training if validation performance doesn't improve for a certain number of epochs to prevent overfitting.
6.  **Hyperparameter Tuning (Manual for MVP):**
    *   Adjust learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, model architecture parameters (e.g., number of layers/units) based on validation performance. Automated hyperparameter optimization is out of scope for MVP.
7.  **Model Saving:** Save the weights of the best performing model (based on validation set) locally.

### 8.4. Inference Process

1.  **Load Tuned Model:** Load the saved model weights into the model architecture.
2.  **Prepare Input Data:** Take new, unseen data (e.g., the test set or recent market data) and apply the same preprocessing and feature engineering steps used for training.
3.  **Prediction:** Perform a forward pass with the model in evaluation mode (`model.eval()` in PyTorch) to get predictions/signals.
4.  **Post-processing:** Convert raw model outputs into a human-understandable format (e.g., actual price prediction, clear buy/sell signal).

### 8.5. Visualization of ML Outputs

*   **Chart Overlays:**
    *   Plot buy/sell signals as markers (e.g., arrows, dots) on the candlestick chart at the corresponding dates.
    *   If forecasting prices, plot the predicted price line alongside the actual price line.
*   **Separate Panels/Tables:**
    *   Display confidence scores for signals, if applicable.
    *   Show key performance indicators (KPIs) of the model on the test set (e.g., accuracy, precision/recall for signals; MSE, MAE for forecasts).
    *   Potentially, a "signal log" table showing recent signals generated by the model.
*   **Tools:** Plotly (via Streamlit/Dash) will be used for these visualizations, as described in the Charting Module.

## 10. Testing Strategy

This section outlines the testing strategy to ensure the quality, correctness, and reliability of the FinRL-based Trading Analysis Platform. A combination of testing levels will be employed.

### 10.1. Unit Testing

#### 10.1.1. Scope and Approach
*   **Focus:** Individual functions, methods, and classes (units of code) will be tested in isolation.
*   **Objective:** Verify that each unit behaves as expected given a set of inputs.
*   **Tools:** `pytest` is recommended as the testing framework for Python. `unittest` (built-in) is an alternative.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Write test cases for all critical functions, especially those in:
        *   `data_manager.py` (e.g., data fetching logic, caching logic).
        *   `indicator_calculator.py` (e.g., RSI calculation, custom indicator loading and execution).
        *   `ml/data_preprocessor.py` (e.g., scaling functions, sequence creation).
        *   `ml/models/` (if custom model components are defined).
    *   Use mock objects (`unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock`) to isolate units from external dependencies like live API calls or database connections. For example, mock `yfinance` calls to return predefined dataframes.
    *   Aim for high test coverage for critical modules.

#### 10.1.2. Example Unit Test Cases

*   **Test Case ID:** UT-IC-001
*   **Module:** `src.core.indicator_calculator`
*   **Function:** `calculate_rsi(data_df, period=14)`
*   **Description:** Verify RSI calculation correctness with known input data and expected output values.
*   **Test Steps:**
    1.  Create a sample Pandas DataFrame with 'Close' prices for which RSI is manually calculated or known from a trusted source.
    2.  Call `calculate_rsi()` with this DataFrame and a specific period (e.g., 14).
    3.  Assert that the returned RSI values are within a small tolerance of the expected values.
    4.  Test edge cases: e.g., data shorter than the period, data with NaNs (if applicable to how NaNs should be handled).
*   **Expected Result:** Calculated RSI values match the pre-calculated/known values.

*   **Test Case ID:** UT-DM-002
*   **Module:** `src.core.data_manager`
*   **Function:** `get_spy_data(use_cache=True)`
*   **Description:** Verify that caching mechanism works: data is fetched from source if no cache, and from cache if cache is present and valid.
*   **Test Steps (Conceptual - requires mocking):**
    1.  Mock `yfinance.download()`.
    2.  Ensure cache directory is empty. Call `get_spy_data()`. Assert `yfinance.download()` was called.
    3.  Call `get_spy_data()` again. Assert `yfinance.download()` was *not* called (data served from cache).
    4.  Modify cache timestamp to be stale. Call `get_spy_data()`. Assert `yfinance.download()` was called again.
*   **Expected Result:** Data is fetched and cached correctly, and cache is utilized appropriately based on its state.

### 10.2. Integration Testing

#### 10.2.1. Scope and Approach
*   **Focus:** Test the interactions and interfaces between different modules of the application.
*   **Objective:** Ensure that integrated components work together as specified.
*   **Tools:** `pytest` can also be used for integration tests.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Test the flow of data between modules:
        *   Data Acquisition -> Data Processing -> Indicator Calculation -> Charting.
        *   Data Acquisition -> Data Processing -> ML Data Preparation -> ML Model Training/Inference -> Charting.
    *   Focus on key integration points, e.g., ensuring the DataFrame output by `data_manager` is correctly consumed by `indicator_calculator` and `ml_data_preprocessor`.
    *   May involve setting up a controlled environment with sample data.

#### 10.2.2. Example Integration Test Cases

*   **Test Case ID:** IT-DI-001
*   **Modules Involved:** `data_manager`, `indicator_calculator`, `plot_generator`.
*   **Description:** Verify that SPY data can be fetched, RSI calculated, and a chart object generated without errors.
*   **Test Steps:**
    1.  Call `data_manager` to fetch (or load from a predefined test file) SPY data.
    2.  Pass the resulting DataFrame to `indicator_calculator` to compute RSI.
    3.  Pass the data and RSI results to `plot_generator` to create a chart object.
    4.  Assert that no exceptions occur during this pipeline.
    5.  Optionally, check basic properties of the generated chart object (e.g., it contains traces for price and RSI).
*   **Expected Result:** The pipeline executes successfully, and a chart object is created.

### 10.3. Functional Testing

#### 10.3.1. Scope and Approach
*   **Focus:** Test the application from the user's perspective against the requirements defined in Section 6 (Detailed Feature Specifications).
*   **Objective:** Verify that the application meets the specified functional requirements.
*   **Tools:** Manual testing based on test scenarios. For web applications (Streamlit/Dash), tools like Selenium or Playwright could be used for automation in later stages, but are out of scope for MVP's primary testing effort.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Develop test scenarios based on user stories or feature specifications.
    *   Execute these scenarios by interacting with the application (either command-line or UI).
    *   Verify that the outputs (charts, console messages, files) are correct.

#### 10.3.2. Example Functional Test Cases

*   **Test Case ID:** FT-CHART-001
*   **Feature:** Display SPY Candlestick Chart with RSI (related to 6.3.1, 6.4.1).
*   **Description:** Verify that a user can successfully view the SPY candlestick chart with the RSI indicator displayed.
*   **Test Steps (Manual - assuming a UI like Streamlit):**
    1.  Launch the application.
    2.  Navigate to the section/page for SPY analysis (if applicable).
    3.  Ensure the SPY candlestick chart is displayed by default or after selection.
    4.  Select/Enable the RSI indicator (e.g., via a checkbox or dropdown).
    5.  Verify that the RSI indicator is plotted correctly (e.g., in a sub-panel) with its period (e.g., 14) and overbought/oversold lines.
    6.  Interact with the chart (zoom, pan) and verify responsiveness.
*   **Expected Result:** The SPY candlestick chart and RSI indicator are displayed correctly and are interactive.

*   **Test Case ID:** FT-ML-002
*   **Feature:** Fine-tune an ML model and view its signals (related to 6.5.2, 6.5.3).
*   **Description:** Verify that the user can trigger ML model fine-tuning and see its generated signals on the chart.
*   **Test Steps (Manual):**
    1.  Ensure prerequisite data (SPY) is loaded.
    2.  Trigger the ML model fine-tuning process (e.g., via a button or command).
    3.  Monitor the process for completion (console logs indicating progress).
    4.  Once tuning is complete, trigger the display of ML signals on the chart.
    5.  Verify that signals (e.g., buy/sell arrows) appear on the chart at appropriate locations based on the model's logic (this requires some understanding of the expected model behavior or pre-calculated expected signals on a small dataset).
*   **Expected Result:** The ML model fine-tuning completes, and its signals are visualized on the chart as specified.

### 10.4. Performance Testing (Future consideration)
*   **Scope:** Evaluate the application's responsiveness, stability, and resource usage under various conditions (e.g., large datasets, multiple indicators).
*   **Objective:** Identify and address performance bottlenecks.
*   **Status:** Not a primary focus for the MVP but should be considered for future versions, especially if the application is scaled or handles larger data volumes/more complex computations.

### 10.5. Usability Testing (Future consideration)
*   **Scope:** Assess how easy and intuitive the application is to use from a user's perspective.
*   **Objective:** Gather feedback to improve the user experience.
*   **Status:** Informal usability assessment can be done during development. Formal usability testing is a future consideration.

### 10.6. FinRL Specific Testing (If applicable)
*   If using FinRL for reinforcement learning agent training or backtesting financial strategies:
    *   **Environment Tests:** Verify custom FinRL environments behave correctly (state transitions, reward calculations).
    *   **Agent Tests:** Test the training loop and convergence of RL agents on simple, known problems if possible.
    *   **Backtesting Accuracy:** If using FinRL's backtesting tools, compare results against manual calculations or other trusted backtesting platforms for simple strategies.
    *   **Status:** Depends on the depth of FinRL's direct usage for RL tasks vs. using it as a data/utility library.

This testing strategy aims to build confidence in the application's functionality and correctness throughout the development lifecycle.
